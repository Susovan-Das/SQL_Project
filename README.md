# SQL_Project
CodeX is a German beverage company that is aiming to make its mark in the Indian market. A few months ago, they launched their energy drink in 10 cities of India.

Their Marketing team is responsible for increasing brand awareness, market share, and product development. They conducted a survey in those 10 cities and received results from 10k respondents.

In this project I have solved some the key important questions provided by the Business, and I have solved those by the help of data collected from the different customers and cities throughout the country.
